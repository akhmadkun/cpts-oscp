# LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning (Linux)

[Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4795) (LLMNR) and [NetBIOS Name Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc940063\(v=technet.10\)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification that can be used when DNS fails. If a machine attempts to resolve a host but DNS resolution fails, typically, the machine will try to ask all other machines on the local network for the correct host address via LLMNR. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. It uses port `5355` over UDP natively. If LLMNR fails, the NBT-NS will be used. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. NBT-NS utilizes port `137` over UDP.

The kicker here is that when LLMNR/NBT-NS are used for name resolution, ANY host on the network can reply. This is where we come in with `Responder` to poison these requests.

```bash
sudo responder -I ens224 
```

Typically we should start Responder and let it run for a while in a tmux window while we perform other enumeration tasks to maximize the number of hashes that we can obtain. Once we are ready, we can pass these hashes to Hashcat using hash mode `5600` for NTLMv2 hashes that we typically obtain with Responder.

We may at times obtain NTLMv1 hashes and other types of hashes and can consult the [Hashcat example hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) page to identify them and find the proper hash mode. If we ever obtain a strange or unknown hash, this site is a great reference to help identify it.
